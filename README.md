## ByVM: Binary Virtual Machine

ByVM is a lightweight, recursive, symbolic virtual machine built on a binary foundation. Inspired by our work on HanoiVM (ternary), ByVM brings a clean binary architecture with a powerful symbolic meta-layer and first-class support for Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI). 

This project is designed to:
- 🧠 Support recursive symbolic computation and meta-programming.
- 🔌 Allow seamless interoperability with C, Python, Rust, and other languages via FFI.
- 📖 Be developed using literate programming principles (`.cweb`).

## 🌐 Features
- **Binary Core VM:** Minimal and fast recursive binary engine.
- **Symbolic Layer:** Meta-symbolic transformations for higher-order logic.
- **FFI Support:** Integrate external code written in C, Python, or others.
- **Literate Programming:** The VM core is written in `.cweb`.
